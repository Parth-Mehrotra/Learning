			The product of two rational numbers is rational.

			Definition: $c$ is rational if it can be written as a as a quotient of two integers.

			Let $a$ and $b$ be rational numbers. We're trying to prove that their product,
			\[
				ab = c
			\]
			$c$ is rational.

			if $a$ and $b$ are rational, they can be written as: 
			\[
				a = \frac{p}{q} 
			\]
			\[
				b = \frac{s}{t}
			\]
			respectively.

			\[
				ab = \frac{pq}{st}
			\]

			Since $p, q, s, t$ are all integers, and integers are closed under multiplication, $pq$ and $st$ are integers. Therefore, $pq$ is a rational number.

			Prove that if $n$ is an integer and $3n+2$ is even, then $n$ is even.
			\subsection*{Contraposition}
				\[
					3n+2 is even \rightarrow n is even
