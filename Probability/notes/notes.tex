		\section*{\Large{\textbf{Set Theory Review}}}

			Sets are collections of unique elements.

			\subsection*{Complement}
				Everything that's not in the set. Denoted by \(A'\),  \(A^C\), or \(\overline{A}\)
			\subsection*{Intersection}
				An operation that takes two sets, and returns the common elements between them. Denoted by \(A \cap B\)

			\subsection*{Union}
				An operation that takes two sets, and returns a all the elements that are in \(A\), \(B\), and \(A \cap B\). Denoted by \( A \cup B \).

			\subsection*{De Morgan's Laws}
				\[ (A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C \]
				\[ (A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C \]

			\subsection*{Disjoint Sets}
				\textbf{Disjoint} sets or \textbf{Mutually Exclusive} sets, are sets that have no elements in common. More formally: \((A \cup B) = \emptyset\)

		\section*{\Large{\textbf{Intro to Probability}}}
			\textbf{Sample Space} of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment.
			An \textbf{event} is any collection (subset) of outcomes contained in the sample space S. An event is said to be \textbf{simple} if it consists of exactly one outcome and \textbf{compound} if it consists of more than one outcome.

		\section*{\Large{\textbf{Counting}}}
			For an ordered pair defined by \((x, y)\) where \(x\) can be selected in \(n_1\) ways, and \(y\) can be selected in \(n_2\) ways, the number of pairs is \(n_1 n_2\). Can be extended to \(k\) dimensions. This is known as the \textbf{Multiplication rule}.

			\subsection*{Permutations}
				For \(k\) selections made \textbf{with replacement} on \(n\) distinct elements, there are \(n^k\) possible outcomes.

				\textbf{Without replacement} however, there are \(n\) options for the first selection, \(n-1\) choices for the next selection, and \(n-k+1\) choice(s) for the \(k^{th}\) selection. This yeilds.

				\[_{n}P_{k} = n(n-1)(n-2) \ldots (n-k+1)\]

			\subsection*{Combinations}
				Given \(n\) distinct objects, the number of \textbf{unordered} subsets of size \(k\) is given by \(_{n}C_{k}\), or \(\binom{n}{k}\) (\(n\) choose \(k\)).

				\[_{n}C_{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(k!)} \]

			\subsection*{Overcounting with Groups}
				For \(n\) distinct objects being devided into \(k\) groups, \(\binom{n}{k} \) over counts by a factor of \(k!\). To account for that, we do the following:
				\[
					\frac{\binom{n}{k}}{k!}
				\]

			\subsection*{Bose Einstein}
				For counting ways to separate \(n\) indistinguisable objects into \(k\) groups. We can use the following:
					\[
						\binom{n - 1 + k}{k}
					\]

				Analogy: For splitting \(n\) peices of candies between \(k\) kids, add \(k-1\) placeholder candies. \(\binom{n-1+k}{k}\) represents all the ways the dividers can be placed, such that the kids get the candy.

			\subsection*{Counting methods summary}
				\begin{center}
					\begin{tabular}{ |c| c c| }
					\hline
					& With order & Without Order \\
					\hline
					With replacement & \( n^k \) & \( \binom{n-1+k}{k}\) \\
					\hline
					Without Replacement & \(\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\) & \(\binom{n}{k} \) \\
					\hline
					\end{tabular}

		\section*{\Large{\textbf{Set inclusion/exclusion principal}}}

			\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]
			\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| \]
		\section*{\Large{\textbf{Conditional Probability}}}
			\(P(A | B)\) represents the probability that \(A\) happens, given that \(B\) \emph{already} happened.
			\[
				P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
			\]

			\subsection*{Bayes' Theorem}
				
				Sometimes we don't have some of those probabilities. In this situation, we can use Bayes' Theorem:
				\[
					P(A|B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} 
				\]

			\subsection*{Law of total probability}
				For an \(A, B\) where \( P(B) \neq 0 \) and \( P(B) \neq 1\)

				\[
					P(A) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) + P(A | B^C) \cdot P(B^C)
				\]

			\subsection*{Multiplication Rule for \(P(A \cap B)\)} 
				\[
					P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)
				\]

			\subsection*{Independence}
				Two Events A and B are independent if \(P(A|B) = P(A)\), and are dependent otherwise. 

				A and B are independent if and only if:
				\[
					P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
				\]

			\subsection*{Mutual Independence}
